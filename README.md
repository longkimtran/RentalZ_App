# RentalZ-app
This app made by me. I create Javascript and HTML/CSS
It is also developed using cordova you can use these commands to make use:

   + npm install -g cordova (install cordova if you have cordova skip this step)
   + cordova platform rm/add ios/android (to remove or add platform android and ios)
   + cordova platform rm/add browser (to remove or add platform Browser)
   + cordova emulate android/ios/browser (to run platform you want)

This app called RentalZ to booking the room from anywhere in Vietnam.
This app just a basic but this is how much my efforts. 
All function I analyze in the report. You can read how that function work in app.
If you like contact me to develop this app better and better.

Thank you !
